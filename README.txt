Melody 🎹

A little Arduiono program to play melodies 
out of loudspeakers.

The program works by producing a series of 
square-wave signals with frequencies set to 
familar notes such as A, B and C. The base 
frequencies are multiplied by certain factors 
to produce higher octave equivalents. Then, 
the notes are simply played in sequence to 
form melodies.
