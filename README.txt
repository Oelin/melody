Melody ðŸŽ¹

A little Arduino program to play melodies out of loudspeakers.

The program works by producing a series of square-wave signals 
with frequencies set to familar notes such as A, B and C. The 
base frequencies are multiplied by certain factors to produce 
higher octave equivalents. Then, the notes are simply played in 
sequence to form melodies.
